## Are you registered to vote in Mecklenburg County?

You must be registered to vote before you can cast a ballot.

If you are not registered at your current address, continue reading to learn how you can still register before Election Day.

If you are already registered, you can proceed to [preview your ballot](/ballot) or find your [polling place](/locations).

## You can still register to vote during early voting!

Rather than sending in your voter registration, you can register to vote and cast a ballot by using same-day registration.

Same-day registration is available at one-stop voting sites throughout Mecklenburg County during early voting. You can not register to vote on Election Day.
